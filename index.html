    <div><h1>Overview </h1><h2>__________________________________________________</h2></div>
    <div class="line">
    <p>The Laboratory was established in 1941 as a research and production centre, known as Drug Research Laboratory of J&K State and was later taken over by Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) of Govt. of India in December 1957 as Regional Research Laboratory, Jammu. In view of  its core strength in natural products based drug discovery, the mandate of  Institute was redefined    in 2005 and its name changed to Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM). The current mandate of IIIM is to discover new drugs and therapeutic approaches from Natural Products, both of plant and microbial origin, enabled by biotechnology, to develop technologies, drugs and products of  high value for the national and international markets.<br><br>

Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, is the President of CSIR.<br><br>

Dr. Harsh Vardhan is the Honâ€™ble Union Minister for Ministry of Science & Technology and Ministry of Earth Sciences.<br><br>

Dr. Shekhar C Mande is the Director General of CSIR.<br><br>

Dr. D. Srinivasa Reddy, is the Director of CSIR-IIIM.</p>

    <br>
    <div><h1>Vision
 </h1><h2>__________________________________________________</h2></div>
    <div class="line">
    <p>The vision of the Institute is to position IIIM as a International center of excellence for natural products chemistry, chemical biology, pharmacology and biotechnology to discover new chemical entities (NCEs) as drugs for unmet medical needs and provide scientific rationale and validity to various Indian systems of medicine. The institute aspires to achieve leadership position as a research Institute for creating a broad knowledge base, a work force of dedicated and trained scientists and a  technology  development center through scientific exploration of secondary metabolites from plants and microbial biodiversity, at the same time generating awareness for their conservation and protection.</p>

    <div><h1>Mandate </h1><h2>__________________________________________________</h2></div>
    <div class="line">
    <p>The mandate of IIIM is to be an internationally competitive centre of excellence in all  facets  of  natural  products research and technology, including (a) discovery of novel pharmacologically active natural products from plants and microbial species and translating them into drug leads and candidates by medicinal chemistry, preclinical pharmacology and clinical development.  This  approach  is  pursued  both in NCE as well as botanical  herbal  mode;  (b)  Preclinical and clinical validation and establishment of mechanism of action of drugs used in various Indian systems of Medicines (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and other Indigenous systems of medicine); (c) develop agro-technologies and commercial cultivation of high value medicinal and aromatic plants from Western Himalayas including Kashmir Valley  and  Laddkh for national and international markets; and (d) to work with Indian and global pharmaceutical industry to out-license new products and technologies.</p>
